A process is an executing (i.e., running) instance of a program. Each process is guaranteed a unique PID, which is always a non-negative integer.

The process init is the only process that will always have the same PID on any session and on any system, and that PID is 1. This is because init is always the first process on the system and is the ancestor of all other processes.

A very large PID does not necessarily mean that there are anywhere near that many processes on a system. This is because such numbers are often a result of the fact that PIDs are not immediately reused, in order to prevent possible errors.

The default maximum value of PIDs is 32,767. This maximum is important because it is essentially the maximum number of processes that can exist simultaneously on a system. Although this will almost always be sufficient for a small system, large servers may require many more processes. The lower the maximum value, the sooner the values will wrap around, meaning that lower values do not necessarily indicate processes that started to run earlier.

The file pid_max, which was introduced with the Linux 2.5 kernel, specifies the value at which PIDs wrap around (i.e., the value in this file is one greater than the maximum PID). It has a default of 32768, but it can be set to any number up to approximately four million. The maximum number of processes on a system is only limited by the amount of physical memory (i.e., RAM) available.

A process can be thought of as an instance of a program in execution. We called this an ‘instance of a program’, because if the same program is run lets say 10 times then there will be 10 corresponding processes.

Moving ahead, each process has its own unique process ID through which it is identified in the system. Besides it own ID, a parent’s process ID is also associated with a process.

A signal is an event generated by the UNIX and Linux systems in response to some condition. Upon receipt of a signal, a process may take action.

A signal is just like an interrupt; when it is generated at the user level, a call is made to the kernel of the OS, which then acts accordingly.

There are two types of signals:

Maskable: signals which can be changed or ignored by the user (e.g., Ctrl+C).
Non-Maskable: signals which cannot be changed or ignored by the user. These typically occur when the user is signaled for non-recoverable hardware errors.
