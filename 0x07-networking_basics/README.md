OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is an abstract model to describe layered communication and computer network design. The idea is to segregate the different parts of what make communication possible.

It is organized from the lowest level to the highest level:

The lowest level: layer 1 which is for transmission on physical layers with electrical impulse, light or radio signal
The highest level: layer 7 which is for application specific communication like SNMP for emails, HTTP for your web browser, etc
Keep in mind that the OSI model is a concept, it’s not even tangible. The OSI model doesn’t perform any functions in the networking process. It is a conceptual framework so we can better understand complex interactions that are happening. Most of the functionality in the OSI model exists in all communications systems.

A Media Access Control (MAC) address is a string of characters that identifies a device on a network. It’s tied to a key connection device in your computer called the network interface card, or NIC. The NIC is essentially a computer circuit card that makes it possible for your computer to connect to a network. A NIC turns data into an electrical signal that can be transmitted over the network.

There are two flavors of IP Addresses that can be used on a network. The first, and the version that the Internet and most routers are currently configured for, is IPv4 or Internet Protocol version 4. This version uses 32-bit addresses, which limits the amount of addresses to 4,294,967,296 possible unique addresses. Some of these addresses, about 290 million, are also reserved for special purposes. Due to the popular growth of the Internet there has been concern that the pool of possible addresses would be exhausted in the near future. With this in mind, a new version of IP addresses was developed called IPv6, or Internet Protocol version 6, that would change the address size from 32-bit address to 128-bit addresses. This change would allow for generous IP address allocations to networks without any foreseeable problem with the amount of addresses available. In order to use IPv6 addresses, though, existing routers and hardware would need to be upgraded or configured to use this new version of IP addresses.

As IPv4 is still the most commonly used, this tutorial will be focusing on that version of IP addresses.

The Address Itself

An IP address always consists of 4 numbers separated by periods, with the numbers having a possible range of 0 through 255. An example of how an IP address appears is: 192.168.1.10

This representation of an IP address is called decimal notation and is what is generally used by humans to refer to an IP address for readability purposes. With the ranges for each number being between 0 and 255 there are a total 4,294,967,296 possible IP addresses.
